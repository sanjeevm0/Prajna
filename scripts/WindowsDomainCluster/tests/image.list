Happy Wednesday, I wish all of you a smooth 2nd half of the week.  Here is picutre of the Space Needle taken on a recent trip to Seattle, Vancouver and Whistler B.C.   This shot is actually 1 vertical frame of a Seattle skyline panorama I've been working on.  For those of you who are wondering, this shot was taken from Kerry Park.  In my opinion it's one of the best locations to shoot the Seattle skyline.

Located on the grounds of Seattle Center, it was built for the 1962 World's Fair, during which time nearly 20,000 people a day used the elevators — 2.3 million visitors in all for the World Fair. The Space Needle is 605 feet (184 m) high and 138 feet (42 m) wide at its widest point and weighs 9,550 tons. When it was completed it was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River. It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 mph (321.8 km/h) and earthquakes up to 9.5 magnitude (which would protect the structure against an earthquake as powerful as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake) and has 25 lightning rods on the roof to prevent lightning damage.	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

The <a href="http://www.earthstation9.com/index.html?1962_sea.htm">1962 Worlds Fair</a> in Seattle took the theme Century 21 and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_needle">Space Needle</a> was a symbol of the future. Want a great picture of the Space Needle? <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kelly_pnw/129900194/">Look here</a>.  I've collected two pieces of memorabilia from 1962; the button pictured here and the guide book in the background. 	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

The Space Needle features an observation deck at 520 feet (160 m), and a gift shop with the rotating SkyCity restaurant at 500 feet (150 m). From the top of the Needle, one can see not only the Downtown Seattle skyline, but also the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Elliott Bay and surrounding islands.   Photographs of the Seattle skyline often show the Space Needle in a prominent position, even appearing to tower above the rest of the city's skyscrapers, as well as Mount Rainier in the background. This occurs because the tower, which is equivalent in height to a 60-story building, stands more than a kilometer northwest of most downtown skyscrapers.  © 2011 Jordyn Murdock Photography	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

Located at the Seattle Center, it was built for the 1962 World's Fair, during which time nearly 20,000 people a day used the elevators, with over 2.3 million visitors in all for the World Fair. The Space Needle is 605 feet (184 m) high at its highest point and 138 feet (42 m) wide at its widest point and weighs 9,550 tons. When it was completed it was the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River.  It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 mph (320 km/h) and earthquakes of up to 9.1 magnitude, which would protect the structure against an earthquake as powerful as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. The tower also has 25 lightning rods on its roof to prevent lightning damage. The Space Needle features an observation deck at 520 feet (160 m), and a gift shop with the rotating SkyCity restaurant at 500 feet (152 m).  From the top of the Needle, one can see not only the Downtown Seattle skyline, but also the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Elliott Bay and surrounding islands. Photographs of the Seattle skyline often show the Space Needle in a prominent position, even appearing to tower above the rest of the city's skyscrapers, as well as Mount Rainier in the background. This occurs because the tower, which is equivalent in height to a 60-story building, stands roughly four-fifths of a mile (1.3 km) northwest of most downtown skyscrapers. Visitors can reach the top of the Space Needle via elevators that travel at 10 mph (16 km/h). The trip takes 43 seconds, and some tourists wait in hour-long lines in order to ascend to the top of the tower. On windy days, the elevators are slowed down to a speed of 5 mph. The Space Needle was designated a historic landmark on April 19, 1999 by the City's Landmarks Preservation Board	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

The Needle required private investment of nearly $4 million.

I'm having a wonderful time they play all the songs the Jades play - only on the radio. I saw the &quot;Doors&quot; in person last Friday night - they were fantastic.

I suppose there are enough tourists around the area that enforcing it would be kinda difficult.  Anyway, we had an hour to kill, so walked around, and I took a few snaps.

Located at the Seattle Center, it was built for the 1962 World's Fair, during which time nearly 20,000 people a day used the elevators, with over 2.3 million visitors in all for the World Fair. The Space Needle is 605 feet (184 m) high at its highest point and 138 feet (42 m) wide at its widest point and weighs 9,550 tons. When it was completed it was the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River. It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 miles per hour (89 m/s) and earthquakes of up to 9.1 magnitude, which would protect the structure against an earthquake as powerful as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. The tower also has 25 lightning rods on its roof to prevent lightning damage.	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

Other highlights include live music, dancing and martial arts demonstrations.  The event commemorates Japan's gift of 1,000 cherry trees to Seattle in 1976. The trees were then planted all around the city, including places like Seward Park and Lake Washington Boulevard. 	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

This photo is an HDR panorama made out of a total of 10 images: 2 frames of 5 images each exposed at between .5 and 15 seconds at f8, 21mm. I created a 5-layer pano out of the source images and merged those to hdr and then tone mapped the output.   When you start paying attention to the notion of line in your architectural photography...well, clearly there is a lot more to think about at that point.	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

I don’t get to experience this type of view much. I remember there were only “this” one, in Seattle, Washington. On top of the Space Needle… Freezing COLD and WINDY !! This one was on December 30, 2008. Hans, Heather and I had dinner here, fortunately enough they have table available for walk-in. We weren’t planning to eat here, it just that after we arrived at the hotel in Seattle, as usual, they decided to stay in the room for a while. Mean while, I went out and start walking, that is when I spot the ALIEN space craft and start walking toward it. By the time I get there, half hour later (and it was around 7pm, freezing cold), H2 called me, so I invited them over to the Space Needle for the restaurant. The food was amazing, the server was great, the view … just amazingly crazy, especially when the restaurant rotate while you are dining there, The Sky City. We get to see the entire Seattle by just sitter there. It was A la carte’ style, with full silver service. The cost??? Let’s not mention it. Haha. Let’s say that, it was an experience that I will never forget…  Another one was actually on December of 2007, but it was on top of City of Angel. It was at the Tallest building in Thailand, Baiyoke Sky Hotel, Bangkok. The resturant here doesn’t rotate like the one in Seattle. However they have an out door balcony that rotate, much faster than the one in Seattle. It was amazing memory, the unforgettable one, none the less, they have a live singer, by a Lady and a Gentleman with guitar that walk around the resturant and sing the song around the resturant. And whao… they walk to our table and I still remember the song, very clearly, and the moment was just… unexplainable.  from <a href="http://www.TwoStepsBehind.com" rel="nofollow">www.TwoStepsBehind.com</a>	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

Just below this ledge is a playground and private homes. People were outside playing in their yards and enjoying the early evening.  Although there were dark clouds, the scene didn't look quite like this.

I waited for an overcast sunset on what was a rainy day (no, I didn’t have to wait long for these conditions). I wanted some contrast in the sky, something to add pop to the local architectural icon. This is was the shot that resulted. ===================================================== The Space Needle is a tower in Seattle, Washington. It is a major landmark of the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and the symbol of Seattle. Located in Seattle Center, it was built for the 1962 World's Fair, during which time nearly 20,000 people a day used the elevators — 2.3 million visitors in all for the World Fair. The Space Needle is 605 feet (184 m) high and 138 feet (42 m) wide at its widest point and weighs 9,550 tons. When it was completed it was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River.[1] It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 mph (320 km/h) and earthquakes up to 9.5 magnitude (which would protect the structure against an earthquake as powerful as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake) and has 25 lightning rods on the roof to prevent lightning damage. ===================================================== The other shot I would LOVE to enter (but can only have one) can be found here:  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/facesplacesandthings/2676589992/">www.flickr.com/photos/facesplacesandthings/2676589992/</a> =====================================================	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

The 12th man is a term commonly used to describe the fans within a stadium during American football or association football games. Since most football leagues allow a maximum of eleven players per team on the playing field at a time, the term denotes the attempt of a team's fans to help their team.  Due to the very nature of fans, their mere presence can have profound impacts on how the teams perform. Namely, the home team fans would like to see their team win the game. Thus these fans will often create loud sounds or chant in hopes of distracting, demoralizing and confusing the opposing team while they have possession of the ball; or to persuade a referee to make a favorable decision. Noises are made by shouting, whistling, stomping and various other techniques.  As a tribute to their fans, the Seahawks retired the number 12 during a game on December 15, 1984. This means no player on the team can wear the number 12 on their jersey. Since then #12 Jerseys have been sold by the team and worn by Seahawk fans, often with the name &quot;Fan&quot; on the back. The Seahawks also have a ceremony before each home game where a flag bearing the #12 is raised by a prominent individual.  This photo was taken from the roof of the Wells Fargo Center in downtown Seattle.

Located at the Seattle Center, it was built for the 1962 World's Fair, during which time nearly 20,000 people a day used the elevators, with over 2.3 million visitors in all for the World Fair. The Space Needle is 605 feet (184 m) high at its highest point and 138 feet (42 m) wide at its widest point and weighs 9,550 tons. When it was completed it was the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River. It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 miles per hour (89 m/s) and earthquakes of up to 9.1 magnitude, which would protect the structure against an earthquake as powerful as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. The tower also has 25 lightning rods on its roof to prevent lightning damage.  The Space Needle features an observation deck at 520 feet (160 m), and a gift shop with the rotating SkyCity restaurant at 500 feet (150 m). From the top of the Needle, one can see not only the Downtown Seattle skyline, but also the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Elliott Bay and surrounding islands. Photographs of the Seattle skyline often show the Space Needle in a prominent position, even appearing to tower above the rest of the city's skyscrapers, as well as Mount Rainier in the background. This occurs because the tower, which is equivalent in height to a 60-story building, stands more than a kilometer northwest of most downtown skyscrapers.  Visitors can reach the top of the Space Needle via elevators that travel at 10 miles per hour (4.5 m/s). The trip takes 43 seconds, and some tourists wait in hour-long lines in order to ascend to the top of the tower. On windy days, the elevators are slowed down to a speed of 5 miles per hour (2.2 m/s). The Space Needle was designated a historic landmark on April 19, 1999 by the City's Landmarks Preservation Board.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <b><i>Permissions</i></b> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  <b>© 2011 Brandon Godfrey</b>  Not for profit bloggers are welcome.

It serves as a reminder for what can be done when you don't have a tripod, perfect prime lens, and the ability to do a quality low ISO, small aperture capture.  All I could do was take snapshots, and I was already at ISO 6400, 1/15th second (sigh), and wide open (f/4) on my mediocre 28-300VR super-zoom.  I at least had the sense to capture three nearly identical frames while holding the camera against the (vibrating) observation deck frame.  By aligning and adding the three noisy frames together in Photoshop, the noise is reduced to something better than an ISO 3200 frame.  I then used Color Efex Pro Tonal Contrast in Fine mode to pull out some detail carefully without adding too much noise (excluded from the sky) and carefully did manual NR (with Dfine) and sharpening (Smart Sharpen and High Pass sharpening with careful blending modes).  Not perfect, but a &quot;nice&quot; memory, nonetheless.	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

The 12th man is a term commonly used to describe the fans within a stadium during American football or association football games. Since most football leagues allow a maximum of eleven players per team on the playing field at a time, the term denotes the attempt of a team's fans to help their team.  Due to the very nature of fans, their mere presence can have profound impacts on how the teams perform. Namely, the home team fans would like to see their team win the game. Thus these fans will often create loud sounds or chant in hopes of distracting, demoralizing and confusing the opposing team while they have possession of the ball; or to persuade a referee to make a favorable decision. Noises are made by shouting, whistling, stomping and various other techniques.  As a tribute to their fans, the Seahawks retired the number 12 during a game on December 15, 1984. This means no player on the team can wear the number 12 on their jersey. Since then #12 Jerseys have been sold by the team and worn by Seahawk fans, often with the name &quot;Fan&quot; on the back. The Seahawks also have a ceremony before each home game where a flag bearing the #12 is raised by a prominent individual.  This shot was taken from the roof of the Wells Fargo Center in downtown Seattle.	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

Located at the Seattle Center, it was built for the 1962 World's Fair, during which time nearly 20,000 people a day used the elevators, with over 2.3 million visitors in all for the World Fair. The Space Needle is 605 feet (184 m) high at its highest point and 138 feet (42 m) wide at its widest point and weighs 9,550 tons. When it was completed it was the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River. It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 miles per hour (89 m/s) and earthquakes of up to 9.1 magnitude, which would protect the structure against an earthquake as powerful as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. The tower also has 25 lightning rods on its roof to prevent lightning damage. [...] Visitors can reach the top of the Space Needle via elevators that travel at 10 miles per hour (4.5 m/s). The trip takes 43 seconds, and some tourists wait in hour-long lines in order to ascend to the top of the tower. On windy days, the elevators are slowed down to a speed of 5 miles per hour (2.2 m/s).

Located at the Seattle Center, it was built for the 1962 World's Fair, during which time nearly 20,000 people a day used the elevators, with over 2.3 million visitors in all for the World Fair. The Space Needle is 605 feet (184 m) high at its highest point and 138 feet (42 m) wide at its widest point and weighs 9,550 tons. When it was completed it was the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River. It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 mph (320 km/h) and earthquakes of up to 9.1 magnitude, which would protect the structure against an earthquake as powerful as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. The tower also has 25 lightning rods on its roof to prevent lightning damage. The Space Needle features an observation deck at 520 feet (160 m), and a gift shop with the rotating SkyCity restaurant at 500 feet (152 m). From the top of the Needle, one can see not only the Downtown Seattle skyline, but also the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Elliott Bay and surrounding islands. Photographs of the Seattle skyline often show the Space Needle in a prominent position, even appearing to tower above the rest of the city's skyscrapers, as well as Mount Rainier in the background. This occurs because the tower, which is equivalent in height to a 60-story building, stands roughly four-fifths of a mile (1.3 km) northwest of most downtown skyscrapers. Visitors can reach the top of the Space Needle via elevators that travel at 10 mph (16 km/h). The trip takes 43 seconds, and some tourists wait in hour-long lines in order to ascend to the top of the tower. On windy days, the elevators are slowed down to a speed of 5 mph. The Space Needle was designated a historic landmark on April 19, 1999 by the City's Landmarks Preservation Board.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle</a>  --  actually used by Renaissance Hotel's guide to Seattle (Aug 2012)  <a href="http://renaissance-hotels.marriott.com/discoveries/skycity-at-the-needle" rel="nofollow">renaissance-hotels.marriott.com/discoveries/skycity-at-th...</a> 	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

I used Photomatix to create the HDR with tonemapping and detail enhanced. I increased the overall saturation with Hue/Saturation in Photoshop. Curve adjustment to increase the overall contrast. 1 layer mask in soft light mode at 50% gray, using brush tool to lighten and darken some areas of the image, to bring out details. Used Nik Sharpener Pro to sharpen image.  Seattle is such a beautiful place! And a great one! I was allowed to posed nude standing in the water fountain and present this all to you flickrites! No! I have not been tagged! I did a 9-exp shot HDR just to make sure my nice-oiled body is not overblown from the sun. Presented in full HDR!

From the observation deck of the Space Needle, there are some great views including this one of Seattle Downtown and Mt Rainier. Seattle's current official nickname is the &quot;Emerald City&quot;. Seattle is also referred to informally as the &quot;Gateway to Alaska,&quot; &quot;Rain City,&quot; and &quot;Jet City&quot;, the latter from the local influence of Boeing. Seattle residents are known as Seattleites.  Mt Rainier is actually in the background but cannot be seen due to the haze	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

Finally, I could manage to come to this place. Spent quite a long time here.  <b>THE PLACE:</b>  The Space Needle is a tower in Seattle, Washington, and is a major landmark of the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and a symbol of Seattle. Located at the Seattle Center, it was built for the 1962 World's Fair, during which time nearly 20,000 people a day used the elevators, with over 2.3 million visitors in all for the World Fair. The Space Needle is 605 feet (184 m) high at its highest point and 138 feet (42 m) wide at its widest point and weighs 9,550 tons. When it was completed it was the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River.[4] It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 mph (320 km/h) and earthquakes of up to 9.1 magnitude.[5] (which would protect the structure against an earthquake as powerful as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake). The tower also has 25 lightning rods on its roof to prevent lightning damage.  The Space Needle features an observation deck at 520 feet (160 m), and a gift shop with the rotating SkyCity restaurant at 500 feet (152 m).[4] From the top of the Needle, one can see not only the Downtown Seattle skyline, but also the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Elliott Bay and surrounding islands. Photographs of the Seattle skyline often show the Space Needle in a prominent position, even appearing to tower above the rest of the city's skyscrapers, as well as Mount Rainier in the background. This occurs because the tower, which is equivalent in height to a 60-story building, stands roughly four-fifths of a mile (1.3 km) northwest of most downtown skyscrapers.  Visitors can reach the top of the Space Needle via elevators that travel at 10 mph (16 km/h). The trip takes 43 seconds, and some tourists wait in hour-long lines in order to ascend to the top of the tower. On windy days, the elevators are slowed down to a speed of 5 mph. The Space Needle was designated a historic landmark on April 19, 1999 by the City's Landmarks Preservation Board <i>(Wiki)</i>   <b><i>(BaoN_40D_20090823_5406)</i></b>	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

Or just <a href="http://flattr.com/thing/1805187/" rel="nofollow">Flattr this</a>.</i>   Here's an image, slightly corrected from the original slide scan, of the Space Needle in Seattle, during the New Years fireworks from NYE 2005.  Taken on Fuji Velvia 50, scanned on a Nikon Super Coolscan 4000D, rotated slightly (my vertical was off by about 2 degrees, sigh), and then tweaked with &quot;curves&quot; a bit in gimp.  I've also made a few <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/newyears_needle" rel="nofollow">products with this image on them</a> available on CafePress.  Prints of this (or its <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindes/113821469/">reversal</a>) available in 8x12 or 12x18.  Contact me for further information...  Unframed, it could be sold at a fairly reasonable price, with or without a mat.  Adding a signature is also possible, though it raises the price, and makes the reversal much more favorable in the case of signing the print itself, though I could sign a mat as well.  For qute a while, this image was in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/cotc/">www.flickr.com/groups/cotc/</a> pool as my most favorited image 2006-09-19; it's also my most viewed, though, and others have higher fav/view ratio... but that's not what's asked about there.  :-)  Oh, and it should be noted that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindes/248862557/">Blue Smoke</a> surpassed it for a bit, and I expect may do so again, but once again (2006-10-05, early AM) this image is in the lead.  (I also won't rotate it out for a little while, for other reasons.)

Alright, it’s not a “tree” per se, but there is a tree made of lights on top of Seattle’s famed Space Needle.  The thought of having to hang them makes me very queasy so I try not to think about it.  The Space Needle stands 605 feet tall and weighs 3,700 tons. As you might imagine, the unique structure required some creative construction techniques, including bending three 90-foot, 90,000-pound I-beams to form each leg. The Needle was built to withstand earthquakes and winds up to 200 miles per hour; in such high winds, the structure itself sways up to 1 inch per 10 mph. Three capsule elevators take you up the Needle’s legs to the Observation Deck, which is 520 feet above the ground. During the 43-second elevator ride, you will get a view through three sides and a brief introduction to the structure.  	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

It rises to the height of 600 feet and is topped by a restaurant which revolves 360ª every hour. About 260 persons can be served. An observation deck and snack service is also atop the Needle for those who wish to feast mostly on the tremendous scenic panorama. This structure represents a private investment of nearly $4,000,000.	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

I saw so many photographs of space needle on flickr but the real challenge was to photograph it differently. Here is one through a sculpture outside the Music Project. Sorry, it was completely dark and i didn't really notice the name of sculpture.  Had to change hue of the sky a bit as it was completely cloudy and there was not enough contrast between the sculpture and the space needle. I saw so many color combinations with the hue change and finally settled with blue. I think monochrome also will look good on this.	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

It is a major landmark of the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and the symbol of Seattle. Located in Seattle Center, it was built for the 1962 World's Fair, during which time nearly 20,000 people a day used the elevators — 2.3 million visitors in all for the World Fair. The Space Needle is 605 feet (184 m) high and 138 feet (42 m) wide at its widest point and weighs 9,550 tons. When it was completed it was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River.[1] It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 mph (320 km/h) and earthquakes up to 9.5 magnitude (which would protect the structure against an earthquake as powerful as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake) and has 25 lightning rods on the roof to prevent lightning damage.  The Space Needle features an observation deck at 520 feet (160 m), the SkyCity restaurant at 500 feet (152 m), and a gift shop.[1] From the top of the Needle, one can see not only the Downtown Seattle skyline, but also the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Elliott Bay and surrounding islands. Photographs of the Seattle skyline often show the Space Needle in a prominent position, even appearing sometimes to tower above the rest of the city's skyscrapers. This occurs because the Space Needle sits roughly four-fifths of a mile (1.3 km) northwest of these skyscrapers, and photographers must capture the city with the Space Needle in the foreground in order to include both it and the rest of the tall buildings. (This angle offers the added bonus of affording a view of Mount Rainier in the background.) At 60 stories it is not remarkably tall, and it is not as close to the cluster of downtown skyscrapers as one might think judging only from the typical angle from which the skyline photographs are taken. Visitors can reach the top via elevators that travel at 10 mph (16 km/h). This trip takes 43 seconds and some tourists wait in hour-long lines in order to ascend to the top of the tower. It was designated a historic landmark on April 19, 1999.[2] It is now owned by the privately held Space Needle Corporation.	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

Finally, I could manage to come to this place. Spent quite a long time here and played with long exposure + zooming.   <b>THE PLACE:</b>  The Space Needle is a tower in Seattle, Washington, and is a major landmark of the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and a symbol of Seattle. Located at the Seattle Center, it was built for the 1962 World's Fair, during which time nearly 20,000 people a day used the elevators, with over 2.3 million visitors in all for the World Fair. The Space Needle is 605 feet (184 m) high at its highest point and 138 feet (42 m) wide at its widest point and weighs 9,550 tons. When it was completed it was the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River.[4] It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 mph (320 km/h) and earthquakes of up to 9.1 magnitude.[5] (which would protect the structure against an earthquake as powerful as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake). The tower also has 25 lightning rods on its roof to prevent lightning damage.  The Space Needle features an observation deck at 520 feet (160 m), and a gift shop with the rotating SkyCity restaurant at 500 feet (152 m).[4] From the top of the Needle, one can see not only the Downtown Seattle skyline, but also the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Elliott Bay and surrounding islands. Photographs of the Seattle skyline often show the Space Needle in a prominent position, even appearing to tower above the rest of the city's skyscrapers, as well as Mount Rainier in the background. This occurs because the tower, which is equivalent in height to a 60-story building, stands roughly four-fifths of a mile (1.3 km) northwest of most downtown skyscrapers.  Visitors can reach the top of the Space Needle via elevators that travel at 10 mph (16 km/h). The trip takes 43 seconds, and some tourists wait in hour-long lines in order to ascend to the top of the tower. On windy days, the elevators are slowed down to a speed of 5 mph. The Space Needle was designated a historic landmark on April 19, 1999 by the City's Landmarks Preservation Board <i>(Wiki)</i>   <b><i>(BaoN_40D_20090823_5397)</i></b>	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

I previously had no information on this piece of art and figured those that remember seeing this photo might be interested in knowing the story behind it.)  <b>SAVING THE BELLTOWN NEEDLE</b> (Pamphlet seen in Belltown's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/suomynona/3976546881/" target="_blank">Bedlam Coffee</a> and typed out word for word)  <a href="http://www.deroux.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Andie deRoux</a>'s Space Needle scale model, found abandoned at 2nd and Bell the autumn of 2008, was an oddly sagging miniature of Seattle's iconic tower. It appeared in the empty lot where the Speakeasy Cafe had once been. deRoux made the &quot;Zoetrope.sculpture&quot; circa 1994-95, commissioned by the owner of Belltown's now gone Downunder nightclub.  Locals discovered the dilapidated needle at the ex-Speakeasy site and installed it where it sat as a makeshift Belltown icon for the better part of the year.  Time and the elements have not been kind to the Belltown Needle, which was not originally designed for the outdoors. Rain, wind, snow, and vandalism -- <i>not to mention being unceremoniously dumped in a vacant lot</i> -- have all left their marks.  Early one Sunday morning, after hearing that the new property owner would soon be regrading the property and hauling the beloved Needle to the dump, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/suomynona/3976546881/" target="_blank">Bedlam</a>, given their love of street art, moved the Needle to its current location to preserve and in it hope of getting it installed as part of the planned Bell Street park boulevard.  It doesn't really look like the Space Needle, you say? Well, recently the damaged saucer section was transported to the artist's studio where Andie deRoux, the original artist, has great plans for restoring the Needle, including rebuilding the saucer completely, then using it to cast a mold from, once molded we could conceivably make as many saucer sections as we wanted.  After getting the Belltown Needle installed in Belltown, we could provide additional copies of the saucer section from Andie's mold to other neighborhood groups, to use in the construction of their own neighborhood-centric Space Needle sculptures.  We are still in the very early stages, but are working toward raising the funds so the Belltown Needle can once again proudly stand at 2nd and Bell Street.

Finally, I could manage to come to this place. Spent quite a long time here and played with long exposure + rotating.   <b>THE PLACE:</b>  The Space Needle is a tower in Seattle, Washington, and is a major landmark of the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and a symbol of Seattle. Located at the Seattle Center, it was built for the 1962 World's Fair, during which time nearly 20,000 people a day used the elevators, with over 2.3 million visitors in all for the World Fair. The Space Needle is 605 feet (184 m) high at its highest point and 138 feet (42 m) wide at its widest point and weighs 9,550 tons. When it was completed it was the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River.[4] It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 mph (320 km/h) and earthquakes of up to 9.1 magnitude.[5] (which would protect the structure against an earthquake as powerful as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake). The tower also has 25 lightning rods on its roof to prevent lightning damage.  The Space Needle features an observation deck at 520 feet (160 m), and a gift shop with the rotating SkyCity restaurant at 500 feet (152 m).[4] From the top of the Needle, one can see not only the Downtown Seattle skyline, but also the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Elliott Bay and surrounding islands. Photographs of the Seattle skyline often show the Space Needle in a prominent position, even appearing to tower above the rest of the city's skyscrapers, as well as Mount Rainier in the background. This occurs because the tower, which is equivalent in height to a 60-story building, stands roughly four-fifths of a mile (1.3 km) northwest of most downtown skyscrapers.  Visitors can reach the top of the Space Needle via elevators that travel at 10 mph (16 km/h). The trip takes 43 seconds, and some tourists wait in hour-long lines in order to ascend to the top of the tower. On windy days, the elevators are slowed down to a speed of 5 mph. The Space Needle was designated a historic landmark on April 19, 1999 by the City's Landmarks Preservation Board <i>(Wiki)</i>   <b><i>(BaoN_40D_20090823_5400)</i></b>	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

I decide with the awesome weather we were having today, I would get a different view of Seattle...one that I have never posted before! I was happy to be able to tote my tripod up to the observation deck, which is at about 60 stories high. It was extremely cold with the wind blowing, as we had some snow yesterday.     I shot this with my Canon 10-22mm EFS lens propped up on my tripod. The tripod did not help much except to stabilize the camera as you really need to lean your tripod against the rail. I wanted to capture the energy of the city with some long exposures and also decided to not crop out the &quot;Saucer's Edge&quot; of the Space Needle for a different feel. You almost could believe that you are hovering above the city in a flying saucer!   I shot three exposures (-2,0,+2) merged and tonemapped in Photomatix 4.0. I then cropped and did a little ghosting cleanup in Photoshop CS5. Final tweaks in Lightroom 3.0.   I want to wish all of my Flickr friends a safe and prosperous New Year! I appreciate your friendship and all of the comments, views and faves over the past year! I hope to continue to grow as a photographer and improve my HDR processing skills...I still have a long ways to go! I also look forward to what 2011 brings in your photo streams!

Those I've shown or sent the flickr link to in Houston have asked, &quot;Where's the Space Needle.&quot;  So, here it is. The information I'm posting is taken from Wikipedia:    The Space Needle is 605 feet (184 m) high and 138 feet (42 m) wide at its widest point and weighs 9,550 tons. When it was completed it was the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River.[4] It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 mph (320 km/h) and earthquakes up to 9.5 magnitude[citation needed] (which would protect the structure against an earthquake as powerful as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake). The tower has 25 lightning rods on its roof to prevent lightning damage.

It was a really bright and cloudless day. Not exactly the best weather for taking photos. I ended up just taking touristy snapshots. Very few turned out well.    I am planning to return to Seattle this fall sometime, and hopefully meet up with some of the many Seattle photographers I know.    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <b><i>Settings</i></b> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -Sony a300 w/ Tamron 10-24 lens -Handheld -10mm -ISO 100 -1/160 exposure -F10 -<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vicfan/5319053337/">Tonemapped</a> in Photomatix Pro 4.0 using one Raw exposure. -Contrast adjustment, vibrance boost, unsharp Mask, and noise reduction in Photoshop CS5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <b><i>Location Info:</i></b> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Space Needle is a tower in Seattle, Washington and is a major landmark of the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and a symbol of Seattle. Located at the Seattle Center, it was built for the 1962 World's Fair, during which time nearly 20,000 people a day used the elevators, with over 2.3 million visitors in all for the World Fair. The Space Needle is 605 feet (184 m) high at its highest point and 138 feet (42 m) wide at its widest point and weighs 9,550 tons. When it was completed it was the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River. It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 miles per hour (89 m/s) and earthquakes of up to 9.1 magnitude, which would protect the structure against an earthquake as powerful as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. The tower also has 25 lightning rods on its roof to prevent lightning damage.  The Space Needle features an observation deck at 520 feet (160 m), and a gift shop with the rotating SkyCity restaurant at 500 feet (150 m). From the top of the Needle, one can see not only the Downtown Seattle skyline, but also the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Elliott Bay and surrounding islands. Photographs of the Seattle skyline often show the Space Needle in a prominent position, even appearing to tower above the rest of the city's skyscrapers, as well as Mount Rainier in the background. This occurs because the tower, which is equivalent in height to a 60-story building, stands more than a kilometer northwest of most downtown skyscrapers.  Visitors can reach the top of the Space Needle via elevators that travel at 10 miles per hour (4.5 m/s). The trip takes 43 seconds, and some tourists wait in hour-long lines in order to ascend to the top of the tower. On windy days, the elevators are slowed down to a speed of 5 miles per hour (2.2 m/s). The Space Needle was designated a historic landmark on April 19, 1999 by the City's Landmarks Preservation Board.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <b><i>Permissions</i></b> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  <b>© 2011 Brandon Godfrey</b>  Not for profit bloggers are welcome.

Photographs of the Seattle skyline often show the Space Needle in a prominent position, even appearing to tower above the rest of the city's skyscrapers, as well as Mount Rainier in the background. This occurs because the tower, which is equivalent in height to a 60-story building, stands roughly four-fifths of a mile (1.3 km) northwest of most downtown skyscrapers.  Visitors can reach the top of the Space Needle via elevators that travel at 10 mph (16 km/h). The trip takes 43 seconds, and some tourists wait in hour-long lines in order to ascend to the top of the tower. On windy days, the elevators are slowed down to a speed of 5 mph.

I have so many photographs from Alaska that you guys are going to get so sick of them when I'm done.  This photo is obviously not from Alaska, but rather from Seattle.  The Space Needle was a bit of a let down becuase it costs $20 and an hour long wait.  It was definitely an experience that I'm glad I had, but I probably wouldn't go again.	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

It rises to the height of 600 feet and is topped by a restaurant which revolves 360° every hour.  About 260 persons can be served.  An observation deck and snack service is also atop the Needle for those who wish to feast mostly on the tremendous scenic panorama.  This structure represents a private investment of nearly $4,000,000. 	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

Originally I had not planned to go up the tower, but ended up going up on the last day I was in Seattle.  Located at the Seattle Center, it was built for the 1962 World's Fair, during which time nearly 20,000 people a day used the elevators, with over 2.3 million visitors in all for the World Fair. The Space Needle is 605 feet (184 m) high at its highest point and 138 feet (42 m) wide at its widest point and weighs 9,550 tons.   +++++++  &quot;Seattle Center&quot; &quot;Space Needle&quot; tower building 1960s 1962 structure architecture 400 &quot;Broad Street&quot;	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

The Black Sun is a 1969 sculpture by Isamu Noguchi.  In 1968 internationally acclaimed artist envisioned creating a fluid and timeless work that would appear to move as the sun does, creating a kind of dialogue between the real sun and the artwork itself.  I thought it framed the space needle nicely...  	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

I managed to get up to three different vantage points during my short trip, and though this one wasn’t my favourite in the end it was certainly the only one which I knew I wanted to do…the other two, Colombia Tower and Smith’s Tower, just kinda happened.

Maybe, in a way, it is.  The story: We were under the eastbound side of the west seattle bridge, by that foundry/forge because the lure of glowing ingots of raw steel was enough to risk hypothermia. After a while, Toby says, wow, look this direction, and there's this great stymetrical array of lights and containers with a backdrop of the city and the needle. It's kind of a weird view and hard to place, but we're looking northeast across Elliott bay and harbor island. This is 9 frames covering +/- 4 EV, so the low is 1/8th, the 0 is 2 seconds and +4 is at 30 seconds. Shot with the manual focus 180mm ED (from 1974!) at f/8, hdr pre-merge in lightroom (adjust wb, minimal sharpening, minimal NR (use radius below .8 with high masking for hdr pre-proc), defringe, de-CA. 16-bit AdobeRGB tifs-&gt;Photomatix with detail enhancer, open in photoshop. They are shining this damn green-tinted light on the space needle these days and it bugs me, so made that look more like the eye sees it, adjusted the overall tonal levels/contrast so the background lights didn't get lost, didn't really need to sharpen or denoise but I did it anyway. Looked dark when I saw it in the daytime because I processed it at night, bumped the lows in lightroom and there ya have it. The foreground lights look like they were done in Maya...it's the haze I guess, and the symetry, that does it.	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

I made my friend to stop at kerry park,away from downtown seattle just to snap the skyline. I am partially high even as i upload this. And the one which is marked as shooting star is actually an aircraft flying past the space needle! i was just damn luck y to spot it.

Although our main target were the National Parks in the area (photos from Mt. Rainier National Park and Olympic National Park are coming shortly), I wanted to get a good look at the city of Seattle. So, I made a selection of best shots that I created with my <a href="http://suadb.wordpress.com/2010/08/06/a-shy-little-wish-list-entry/" rel="nofollow">new Mamiya 7 camera</a>; these photos were made on Ilford Delta 100 black and white film.  I've been <a href="http://suadb.wordpress.com/2010/12/10/lower-manhattan-sunset/" rel="nofollow">on top of a few famous buildings</a>, so I didn't want to spend time and money climbing on top of Space Needle. I'm sure the view is great, but I had limited time to spend downtown, and the ticket was slightly over priced. Nevertheless, it's still a very cool, sleek structure, in the middle of the city, surrounded by parks and businesses of all kinds.

Alas, work kept me a little too busy for any landscape photography. Still, I got to catch up with a couple of Flickr friends in Portland (Hi Kurt, Shelly, Don!), and I found some time to see the Chihuly exhibition at the Seattle Center.  The Garden and Glass exhibition was a little like seeing old friends in new ways. There were many pieces that I had gotten to know while they were displayed at Phoenix's Desert Botanical Garden. It was interesting to remember the setting in Phoenix and the compare to how they are being displayed in Seattle.  I don't think this view of the Space Needle is original since the exhibit opened. But I think it's a very nice way of framing the structure.	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

One of the few locations where it's perspective blends into the skyline is at Kerry Park in the Queen Anne District.  It's a small park and there's no parking anywheres.  You have to look and park on the street somewheres and hoof it to the small park with the great view.  This day I scrambled to three locations to get different skyline views. I posted one from the bridge earlier in the week with no Needle, and then this one. Later I'll post one from the West Seattle Waterfront.  However, other than this location,  if you want the Needle in a shot, it's gonna have to be in a Pano format, so a pano tripod head is a necessity when shooting in Seattle.

Something happened to my knee last Friday, and I have been limping around pretty regularly ever since.  A normal person would get that checked out, but I just keep assuming that it will go away.  My stomach is killing me on top of it.  I can't seem to catch a break, apparently.  Seem to have gone TTV crazy with a lot of the Seattle photos.  Just another one of those phases, I guess.  This was shot in some kind of amusement park.  Thought it was neat that the Space Needle stood behind it.	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

I feel like this image was a little out of the ordinary for me. Usually, I'm out catching more dramatic scenes but the weather was so nice yesterday evening, that I could not resist.   This is a vertical panoramic shot of the Space Needle using four images stitched together in Photoshop CS5. Fairly simple for the most part, and CS5 does a great job matching the exposure to make the image appear as if it is one seamless image. There was a fair amount of distortion but I was able to straighten a lot of it out in post processing.

Gehry structure.  The Space Needle was originally constructed as part of the Worlds Fair in Seattle in 1962.  This photo was taken when there was still snow left from the unusual snowfall in January.  The snow slid off the slick surfaces of the EMP building.  Safety barriers kept the public away from the snow slides.  	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

The food was pretty good and the view was amazing!!  We wanted to go at night but of course there were no night reservations available - so call a week or so in advance if you want to go for dinner!  The Space Needle is a tower in Seattle, Washington, and is a major landmark of the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and a symbol of Seattle. Located at the Seattle Center, it was built for the 1962 World's Fair, during which time nearly 20,000 people a day used the elevators, with over 2.3 million visitors in all for the World Fair. The Space Needle is 605 feet (184 m) high at its highest point and 138 feet (42 m) wide at its widest point and weighs 9,550 tons. When it was completed it was the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River. It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 mph (320 km/h) and earthquakes of up to 9.1 magnitude, which would protect the structure against an earthquake as powerful as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. The tower also has 25 lightning rods on its roof to prevent lightning damage.  The Space Needle features an observation deck at 520 feet (160 m), and a gift shop with the rotating SkyCity restaurant at 500 feet (152 m). From the top of the Needle, one can see not only the Downtown Seattle skyline, but also the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Elliott Bay and surrounding islands. Photographs of the Seattle skyline often show the Space Needle in a prominent position, even appearing to tower above the rest of the city's skyscrapers, as well as Mount Rainier in the background. This occurs because the tower, which is equivalent in height to a 60-story building, stands roughly four-fifths of a mile (1.3 km) northwest of most downtown skyscrapers.  Visitors can reach the top of the Space Needle via elevators that travel at 10 mph (16 km/h). The trip takes 43 seconds, and some tourists wait in hour-long lines in order to ascend to the top of the tower. On windy days, the elevators are slowed down to a speed of 5 mph. The Space Needle was designated a historic landmark on April 19, 1999 by the City's Landmarks Preservation Board.

NOTE:  This is a first post created from my JPEG files which were daylight color balanced.  I haven't had a chance to work the raw files from home yet..., later).  The Flickr Seattle Photo Group arranged an evening shoot from Kerry Park about one night after the full moon, reporting that the full moon would rise above the Seattle downtown skyline.  I was a bit skeptical, since I'd seen the moon rise farther to the north during the summer months, but the organizers were not only correct, but spectacularly correct.    This photo is a composite of two photos shot with my Canon 5D MK II at ISO 100 using a Canon 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6lens.  The moon shot was about 1/30 sec., the Space Needle shot was 1.6 seconds, both at f/5.6.  I'll post all the details later.  Note that my preference/intent *would* have been to shoot this all at f/8 or f/11 to get a sharper image.  I'd been alternating with my 300mm f/2.8 lens which I'd set to f/5.6, so it was just an absent-minded bumble on my part not to stop down and adjust the aperture/shutter speeds for the 100-400 f/5.6 lens.   <em>This photograph is </em><strong><i>not</i></strong><em> in the public domain and may </em><strong><i>not</i></strong><em> be used in electronic, print, or any other form, without advance permission from <a href="mailto:touchinglightphotography.gmail.com" rel="nofollow">Richard Mitchell</a>.</em>  <strong><a href="http://www.touchinglightphotography.com/" rel="nofollow">Richard Mitchell Touching Light Photography </a></strong>| <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/touchinglightphotography/">Flickr </a>| <a href="http://twitter.com/ddnarich" rel="nofollow">Twitter </a>|<a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1223141087#!/album.php?aid=64334&amp;id=1223141087" rel="nofollow">Facebook </a>| <a href="http://www.touchinglightphotography.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Blog </a>| <a href="mailto:touchinglightphotography@gmail.com" rel="nofollow">Email</a>   	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

As a child interested in space and futuristic ideas, I wanted our family to attend the fair on vacation.  There was only one problem - Dad loved us kids, but he could not stand being cooped up in a car with two adults and four children.    It had only been a year earlier that we spent a month touring the east, before returning from a temporary assignment at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio to our home in Utah.    Dad had enough of &quot;family togetherness&quot; on that trek.  My uncle in Maryland, who was single at the time and lead a rather colorful life, attended the fair.  We weren't particularly close, but he spent a few days in Utah on his return trip to Maryland.  He gave me a t-shirt with the Space Needle.  It was my favorite article of clothing until I outgrew it a year later.  That may be what started my habit of buying t-shirt's when I travel.  Interestingly, I did not buy a t-shirt on this, my first visit to Seattle and the Space Needle.  I boosted the color saturation because I wanted a blue sky in this photo.	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

At least I proved in theory that a Star Circle surrounding the Space Needle is possible.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/urbanstartrail/">Urban star trails</a> are not simple, however!  This would have definitely worked better in portrait mode. The bugaboo was avoiding the glaringly bright light that you see in the lower left.  No, that's not the light, that's RIMLIGHT off the top of my black knit hat while I strategically stood there to block the unwanted light and waited to capture enough images.

The biggest concern being the protection of views of the Space Needle from public spaces.   I'm on the fence about the whole matter, realizing that cities are very much living organisms that need to grow and expand to flourish. Yet there should always be an effort made to protect and preserve the essence of what makes a given city great in the first place.   Few things are more Seattle, than the Space Needle, and I like the fact that no matter where I am on Capitol Hill, my neighborhood, chances are I can see the Space Needle. The thought of new high rises removing that possibility is a bid saddening.   	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

Since I had my camera in the trunk “just in case” I decided to swing by Space Needle and take some shots. As soon as I got out of the car, I could see that I needed to move quick as the clouds kept changing and the sun was going down fast. I literally had just enough time to set up my tripod and fire off 1 set of 9 bracketed exposures before the clouds were gone and there was only blue sky left. Not like I should be complaining about cloudless skies in Seattle :-) Anyway, talk about being in the right place at the right time and it paid to have my gear on me!	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

I shot this picture of the Space Needle from Kerry Park.  That ought to tell you how much magnification 1300mm really is.  From the Kerry Park vantage point, the Space Needle is 1kM (0.61Mi) away.  At 1300mm focal length on a cropped body camera, the lens has a Field Of View (FOV) of 1 deg x, 0.7 deg y, 1.2 deg diagonal.  Framing a subject is therefore like picking a needle in a haystack - for a comparison, a stock Russian AK47 assault rifle can expect to shoot about 5 minute-of-angle accuracy, an American M16 about 3MOA.  The fact that what this camera sees is only about 30x wider than what an infantry rifle shoots ought to tell you how hard it is to aim.  To facilitate aiming ... I gimped onto the camera mount a cheap Chinese copy of a Bushnel HoloSight.  It works by projecting the illusion of a floating cross hair and aiming reticle about 5 ft in front of the shooter.  The rail was ... hastily attached to the original tripod mount ring (which is too weak to hold the weight of the telescope and DSLR) and taped in place with clear packing tape (hey, it's a quick prototype).  Then, with the sights set on the Space Needle, I locked the camera tripod head and bought the aiming crosshairs on the space needle to correspond to what the camera sees, using the bullet drop and windage adjustment knobs on the sight.  Total setup was about $30.00 for the sight and rail, and about 1 hr of design time and some 3D Printing magic.  Version 2 of the mount will incorporate a less ghetto sight rail, as well as a front bi-pod and rifle stock and pistol grip attachment to allow shooting without a heavy tripod.  And I wasn't kidding about being able to read the Exit sign over the emergency exit...	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

Built in 1962, the Space Needle served as the symbol of that year's World's Fair. It has since become the symbol of Seattle, and one of the most recognizable structures in the world.

We did a lot of tourist things - took the light rail from the airport to Westlake Center, the monorail to Seattle Center to check out the Space Needle, then ambled to the Pike Street Market - we spent a lot of time there checking out the produce (fruity and colorful), flowers (very colorful) and people (very fruity and colorful)! We ended up on the Waterfront supporting the economy by ingesting a bunch of snow crabs - good stuff!

Seattle is a pretty cool town.  In addition to staying in Seattle we took a little side trip down to Portland, Oregon to see the city.  After that we went to the coast and took in Cannon Beach which is one of the most amazing places ive ever seen.  This is a shot of the Space Needle taken from West Seattle.  I have another shot similar to this in color with the streak of a boat on the Puget Sound but I think there is something powerful and iconic about this shot.

I parked near the football field earlier in the day and I walked from here to the Space Needle. It looks close but it will take you about 45 minutes to an hour to get to that side of the city. 	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

It was built for the 1962 World's Fair and has become one of the ten most photographed structures in the world. I have many shots from Kerry Park, but wanted to make sure I got a shot with it's roof painted the golden orange color (Officially called &quot;Galaxy Gold&quot;). It normally is white, but has a nice minty color when illuminated at night. The roof was painted to celebrate the anniversary of the World's Fair and is supposed to stay that way for the next six months.   This is a combination of three exposures (-2,0,+2) merged and tonemapped in Photomatix. I did a little &quot;Dodge and Burn&quot; to bring out a little more drama and processed the shot with a slight &quot;Painterly&quot; look. Added the vignette in Lightroom.   Thank you for your views, comments and faves. I appreciate them. I hope everyone enjoyed their weekend. We sure did here in the Pacific Northwest as we basked in the sun and pleasant weather which has been lacking this Spring!

Thankfully, I have a friend who lives in Lower Queen Anne with roof access.   The original shot was taken in color - then I used Silver Efex to process it in black and white. Black and white isn't really my forte, but after fiddling with the image for a bit, I think I'm pleased with the results.

Having spent three weeks in the US, mainly in Montana the flights out of Seattle back to UK were such that some time was available  to be spent in this fine city.   Home to the '62 World's Fair the Space tower was built at that time, It was then 'state of the art' and now a 50 year old monument to those times.  The Monorail tracks can be seen running along the centre of the shot to the downtown area.   The view from the top is not always great, Seattle has a reputation of being a wet and sometime misty town but not on this day. 	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM	0	0

Very interesting conditions that were constantly changing.  I'll be posting quite a few more images I think.  Tomorrow morning will be nice too probably.
