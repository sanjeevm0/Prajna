    Description: 
        A open distributed gateway / server that support distributed query. This library abstracts
    M global clusters of gateway node (for traffic direction) and N clusters of recognition node. 
    Based on certain performance mapping (specified by the user) the gateway node will redict the 
    incomming traffic to 1 or N backend node for processing. 

        With Prajna, the status of the gateway (query statistics information) & query of the recognition
    service can be realtime access by the user. 
    
        The service library targets web/image/video/audio developer.
